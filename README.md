# Pixel Art Maker Project
This is the final project for the Udacity Google Challenge Scholarship for Front-End Web Development. I had a blast working on this final project, as I got to combine my love for climbing and my newfound passion for coding into one.

## Goal
To build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas!

Students are given [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter), including HTML and CSS, to build the application. JavaScript code is written that lets the user to create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

## Project Features
Users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

The primary task is to implement the `makeGrid()` function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

## Skills
* Defining variables with `const` and `let`
* Accessing the DOM using methods of the `document` object (encouraged to use jQuery)
* Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
* Writing nested loops and using loop variables
